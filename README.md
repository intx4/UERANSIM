**UERANSIM** <small>(pronounced "ju-i ræn sɪm")</small>, is the open source state-of-the-art 5G UE and RAN (gNodeB)
simulator. UE and RAN can be considered as a 5G mobile phone and a base station in basic terms. The project can be used for
testing 5G Core Network and studying 5G System.

UERANSIM introduces the world's first and only open source 5G-SA UE and gNodeB implementation.

**WARNING:** I'm no longer active in the development of UERANSIM. However community contributions are welcomed.

## This Fork
This Fork simply enables logging of registration traces from ```nr_ue``` to stdout, which is used as a work around for actual network sniffing. 

## Documentation
